## 📌 SOA, RESTful APIs, SOAP – Quick Gist

### 🔹 SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)

* Architecture pattern for distributed systems.
* Services = reusable, loosely coupled, discoverable, stateless.
* Uses protocols like **SOAP** over **HTTP/JMS**.
* Components: **Service Provider, Consumer, Registry (UDDI)**.

### 🔹 SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

* **Protocol** for message exchange.
* Uses **XML**, **WSDL** for contracts.
* Works over **HTTP, SMTP**.
* Features: **WS-Security**, **transactions**, **ACID compliance**.

### 🔹 REST (Representational State Transfer)

* **Architectural style**, not a protocol.
* Uses **HTTP methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH.
* Stateless, cacheable, scalable.
* Payload: usually **JSON**.
* Preferred for **mobile/web APIs** and microservices.

### 🔹 REST vs SOAP

| Feature     | REST         | SOAP            |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Lightweight | ✅            | ❌               |
| Data Format | JSON, XML    | XML only        |
| Security    | OAuth, HTTPS | WS-Security     |
| Use Case    | Web APIs     | Enterprise, B2B |

### 🎯 Interview Questions – SOA/REST/SOAP

1. **What is SOA?**
   → An architecture style where independent services interact over a network via standard protocols.

2. **SOAP vs REST?**
   → SOAP = protocol with strict contracts, XML, WS-Security.
   → REST = lightweight, stateless, uses HTTP verbs, JSON.

3. **When to use SOAP over REST?**
   → For secure, reliable, transactional messaging (e.g., banking, legacy apps).

4. **How does REST achieve statelessness?**
   → Each request contains all necessary context; no session state stored on server.

## 📌 XML, XSD, XSLT, JSON – Quick Gist

### 🔹 XML

* Markup language for **data storage + exchange**.
* **Tag-based, hierarchical, verbose**.
* Used in SOAP, config files, system integration.

### 🔹 XSD (XML Schema Definition)

* Defines **rules & structure** for XML.
* Validates element types, min/max values, required fields.

### 🔹 XSLT

* Transforms XML into **other XML**, HTML, or text.
* Used in **presentation, transformation**, data mapping.

### 🔹 JSON

* Lightweight **data-interchange format** (key-value).
* **Human-readable**, used in **REST APIs, web apps**.
* Faster + smaller than XML.

### 🔹 XML vs JSON

| Feature    | XML          | JSON             |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Format     | Tag-based    | Key-value        |
| Verbose    | High         | Low              |
| Schema     | XSD          | JSON Schema      |
| Common Use | SOAP, config | REST, web/mobile |

### 🎯 Interview Questions – XML/XSD/XSLT/JSON

1. **What is XSD and why is it important?**
   → It validates the structure and data types in XML, ensuring data integrity.

2. **When would you use XSLT?**
   → To transform XML into another format (e.g., HTML or new XML schema).

3. **Difference between XML and JSON?**
   → XML is verbose and tag-based, suited for SOAP. JSON is lightweight, fast, suited for REST.

4. **Can JSON have schema validation like XML?**
   → Yes, via JSON Schema (less strict/widespread than XSD).
